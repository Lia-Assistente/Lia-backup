## Google Ads & Browser Setup

### Progress
- Julio wants to run Google Ads monitoring
- Browser was disabled, now enabled
- Installed Chromium on VPS (`/usr/bin/chromium`)
- Configured OpenClaw to use Chromium as browser

### Current Issue
Browser control service not starting via nodeHost. Still debugging.

### Next Steps
- Restart gateway after config change
- Test browser functionality
- Recreate Google Ads monitoring script (was lost during refactoring)

### Julio's Preferences
- Prefers Portuguese
- Wants fixes without asking - just do it and notify
